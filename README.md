# Engeto-PBI-project

Welcome to my ever first Microsoft Power Bi project!

In this project i decided to work with dataset from Eurostat which contains crime statistics for years 2011 - 2020 grouped by categories -
homicide, theft, sexual violence and rape.

https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/CRIM_OFF_CAT$DEFAULTVIEW/default/table?lang=en

I created Main page for all crimes together and then a single page for every crime category. You can browse information about 35+ countries for every single year.
